# A Spring project on Scheduling of addition and deletion posts

 

Introducing our project that focuses on **scheduling posts**, a feature-rich solution designed to empower users with the ability to plan. Our project streamlines the process of creating, timing, and publishing posts.

# How to make a scheduled post?

 

After logging into your forum and enter the content, then click on **date and time** prompt and set the date and time you wish to publish your post.

 

If you don't want to schedule a post, you can simply disregard the date and time option and proceed with publishing your post.

 

# How does it work in backend?

 

**Task Scheduling:** Users or administrators input the content they want to publish along with the specific date and time they want it to be published. Your scheduler stores these scheduling requests in a queue or database, maintaining the scheduled publication timestamps.

 

**Scheduling Logic:**
The scheduler constantly monitors the system clock or uses a timer mechanism to keep track of the current time. At regular intervals or in real-time, the scheduler checks if the current time matches any of the scheduled publication times from the queue.

 

**Task Activation:** When the current time matches a scheduled publication time, the scheduler activates the task associated with that post. This task typically involves posting content to a designated platform, such as a social media platform, blog, or website.
